The video card is used to handle a display. This emulator emulates an AVC64 Video Card.
The AVC64 Video Card can handle a 224 * 256 px display with 256 colors.
This card has 2 drawing modes:
- single pixel  (0x00)
- texture       (0x01)

The registers are:
X: 8 bit used to store X coordinate
Y: 8 bit used to store Y coordinate
D1: 8 bit used to store data such as colors or texture id


The bus are

8 bit data bus      
    - in single pixel mode is used for passing the color
    - in clear mode is used to pass the color
    
1 bit mode bus
    - 0 R (read) used to read a color of a certain pixel in single pixel mode
    - 1 W (write)
4 bit operation bus
    - SP (0x00) Single Pixel (R to read a color of a pixel, W to write a pixel, coordinates are stored in X and Y, color is in D1)
    - TX (0x01) TeXture (mode bus must be W, the texture ID high is stored in D1 and low in D2. For 2 colors mode only, FG color is stored in D3 and BG color in D4, coordinates are stored in X and Y)
    - CL (0x02) CLear the screen with the color specified in D1 register (mode bus must be W)
    - CX (0x03) Used to write or read the X coordinate register
    - CY (0x04) Used to write or read the Y coordinate register
    - D1 (0x05) Used to write or read the D1 register
    - D2 (0x06) Used to write or read the D2 register
    - D3 (0x07) Used to write or read the D3 register
    - D4 (0x08) Used to write or read the D4 register
    - NOP (0x09) No Operations

Video card internal mapping:
  from <included> to <included> <size B> <info>
- from 0x0000     to 0x1FFF     8'192    Texture and font map
- from 0x2000     to 0xFFFF     57'344   Video memory (256 * 224 resolution 256 colors)

Texture and font file header:
    0       1       2       3       4    5  5       6       7   (bytes)

Where CL can be:
- 2 colors mode            (1 bit size)
- 2 colors 1 alpha mode    (2 bit size)
- 16 colors mode           (4 bit size)
- 16 colors 16 alpha mode  (8 bit size)
- 256 colors mode          (8 bit size)
- 256 colors 16 alpha mode (12 bit size)
