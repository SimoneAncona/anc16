The video card is used to handle a display. This emulator emulates an AVC64 Video Card.
The AVC64 Video Card can handle a 224 * 256 px display with 256 colors.
This card has 2 drawing modes:
- single pixel  (0x00)
- texture       (0x01)
The bus are
8 x coordinates bus  
    - used in single pixel mode for passing coordinates
8 y coordinates bus
    - used in single pixel mode for passing coordinates
8 bit data bus      
    - in single pixel mode is used for passing the color
    - in texture mode is used to pass the texture ID
1 bit mode bus
    - 0 R (read) used to read a color of a certain pixel in single pixel mode
    - 1 W (write)
2 bit operation bus
    - SP (0x00) Single Pixel (R to read a color of a pixel, W to write a pixel)
    - TX (0x01) TeXture (mode bus must be W)
    - CL (0x02) CLear the screen with the color specified in data bus (mode bus must be W)
    - NOP (0x03) No Operations

Video card internal mapping:
  from <included> to <included> <size B> <info>
- from 0x0000     to 0x1FFF     8'192    Texture and font map
- from 0x2000     to 0xFFFF     57'344   Video memory (256 * 224 resolution 256 colors)

Texture and font file header:

Where CL can be:
- 2 colors mode            (1 bit size)
- 2 colors 1 alpha mode    (2 bit size)
- 16 colors mode           (4 bit size)
- 16 colors 16 alpha mode  (8 bit size)
- 256 colors mode          (8 bit size)
- 256 colors 16 alpha mode (12 bit size)
